  - For our project, we primarily used the Expo Go app to run our MediTrack application because it allows for quick testing and development across both iOS and Android devices.
  - Download the Expo Go app from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
  - Once downloaded, if you are using an iOS device, simply open your phone's camera and scan the QR code provided.
  - If you are using an Android device, open the Expo Go app and use the built-in QR code scanner to access the MediTrack application.
  - You are ready to use MediTrack!
